My name is Jack Jamison. I'm an American software engineer studying at the [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu) in New York. I've been programming since I was a little kid.

I enjoy GPU programming, cross-platform desktop application design, build systems, game development, and system administration. I'm also interested in operating systems and networking, but I haven't pursued them yet.

I use Emacs as my text editor. I've spent a lot of time configuring it. If you want, you can check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/JackJ30/dotfiles).

If you want to talk to me, I would love to also. Feel to reach out at my [email](mailto:jackqjamison@gmail.com).
