This is an in-progress character controller inspired by *Dishonored*, *Dark Messiah*, and *Thief*. It is fully physics based and interacts with the engine. It navigates steps and slopes, has a swimming system, a dynamic crouching system, a climbing system, a sliding system, and several other components. The project also contains a saving system which can serialize the level and its physics objects, supporting completely re-ordering the scene tree, spawning in objects and deleting them. It was made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
