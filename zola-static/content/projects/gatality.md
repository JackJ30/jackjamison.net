[Gatality](https://gatality.com/) is an open-source desktop application for designing and simulating digital circuits at scale.
I've been co-leading the development of this project with a friend for [RCOS](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/?id=main). I've worked on the application structure, code design, and wrote the Vulkan renderer.
