[Jack's Table Wrangler](https://github.com/JackJ30/table-wrangler) is a CLI and TUI for viewing and editing tables written in Golang. You can transform the table (remove columns, filter, etc) and save presets for future invocations. I developed this for Kubernetes tables while I was working at Coreweave after an awk wasn't cutting it anymore.
